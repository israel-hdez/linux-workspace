# Specify some identities for GitHub, so that it is easier to use multiple
# accounts in the same machine. The first one is the default and it is a symlink
# to the one that ssh-keygen creates with default name for an ed25519 key.
# The gh_israel host will rarely be used, since is the account I use mostly. So,
# the secondary gh_edgar entry is the one that would be configured for the
# repositories that are stored in that account.
